# eager-Approach
Goal. Design efficient data structure for union-find.
・Number of objects N can be huge. 
・Number of operations M can be huge. 
・Union and find operations may be intermixed.

Result

Quadratic algorithms don't scale with technology. 
・New computer may be 10x as fast. 
・But, has 10x as much memory ⇒ 
want to solve a problem that is 10x as big. 
・With quadratic algorithm, takes 10x as long
